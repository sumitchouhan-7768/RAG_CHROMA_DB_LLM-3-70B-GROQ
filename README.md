# RAG with Chroma DB and LLM-3-70B (GROQ)

This project demonstrates the implementation of **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** using **Chroma DB** as the vector database and **LLM-3-70B** (via GROQ) as the large language model. The goal is to build a system that retrieves relevant information from a knowledge base and generates accurate, context-aware responses.

## Overview

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines the power of retrieval-based systems and generative models to provide accurate and contextually relevant responses. This project uses **Chroma DB** as the vector database for efficient similarity search and **LLM-3-70B** (via GROQ) as the generative model to produce high-quality outputs.

---

## Features

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Combines retrieval and generation for accurate, context-aware responses.
- **Chroma DB Integration:** Utilizes Chroma DB for fast and efficient vector-based similarity search.
- **LLM-3-70B Model:** Leverages the power of the LLM-3-70B model via GROQ for high-quality text generation.
- **Scalable and Modular:** Designed to be easily extendable for different use cases and datasets.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Chroma DB:** A vector database for efficient storage and retrieval of embeddings.
- **LLM-3-70B:** A large language model for text generation.
- **GROQ:** A platform for running large-scale AI models efficiently.
- **Python:** The primary programming language used for implementation.
- **Hugging Face Transformers:** For working with pre-trained language models.
- **FAISS (optional):** For similarity search (if not using Chroma DB).

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sumitchouhan-7768/RAG_CHROMA_DB_LLM-3-70B-GROQ.git
   cd RAG_CHROMA_DB_LLM-3-70B-GROQ
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up Chroma DB:**
   - Install Chroma DB:
     ```bash
     pip install chromadb
     ```
   - Configure Chroma DB as per your requirements.

5. **Configure GROQ API:**
   - Obtain an API key from GROQ.
   - Add the API key to the configuration file or environment variables.

## Usage

1. **Load Data into Chroma DB:**
   - Use the provided scripts to load your dataset into Chroma DB for retrieval.

2. **Run the RAG Pipeline:**
   - Execute the main script to run the RAG pipeline:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```

3. **Query the System:**
   - Input your query, and the system will retrieve relevant information from Chroma DB and generate a response using the LLM-3-70B model.

---

## Configuration

The project can be configured using the `config.yaml` file or environment variables. Key configurations include:

- **Chroma DB Settings:** Path to the database, collection name, etc.
- **GROQ API Key:** Required for accessing the LLM-3-70B model.
- **Model Parameters:** Adjust parameters like temperature, max tokens, etc.
